# Flutter Tutorials – #1.2 – WebView Controller – Completer, Future Builder, Await - Async

## Introduction

Welcome to Himdeve development, where we are preparing the best tutorials to make your mobile app development easier and more efficient.

## Goal

1. In this second part of our Flutter series of tutorials, we will add a controller for our WebView to be able to fully control it, such as getting the current url, going forward, backward, refreshing the page, clearing the cache and so on. In our case, we will display the current url address on the screen.

2. In addition, we add topBar and floating action button to the application.

3. We will learn the difference between the Stateless Widget and the Stateful Widget.

4. And also basic info about the concept of Future, FutureBuilder, Completer and Async - Await mechanism in Flutter.
